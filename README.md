# Health-Cloud-Sfdx-Template
A template for spinning up a Health Cloud-backed scratch org. To spin up the current release of [Health Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/products/health-cloud/overview/), use the following commands to start and open your org.

```
$ healthcloud start
$ healthcloud open
```

You can let your scratch org expire on its own, but try and be nice to your org limits and stop your scratch org when you are done with it by executing `healthcloud stop`.

Your scratch org will have the alias `healthcloud`.

# Creating a pre-release version of Health Cloud
During a Salesforce release window, you can also use this template to spin up a pre-release version of Health Cloud.

```
$ healthcloud start --prerelease
$ healthcloud open --prerelease
```

To clean up after creating a pre-release version,please execute `healthcloud stop --prerelease`.

Your pre-release scratch org will have the alias `healthcloud-prerelease`.
