Member became very angry after informing member the rejection was possible due to the medication being a immunosuppressant drug, which requires authorization from the provider. Member states the pharmacy called yesterday to run the prescription and were told that the medication was Part B covered and did not mention anything about a prior authorization, member states at the time if they were informed of that, member would have done the authorization. Member then continued to express his frustration stating this medication was extremely important to prevent his body rejecting his kidney that he waited years for.",
